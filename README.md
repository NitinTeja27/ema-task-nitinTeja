# Natural Language Query Agent

The primary objective of this project is to develop a Natural Language Query Agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and open-source vector indexing and storage frameworks to provide concise responses to straightforward queries within a substantial dataset comprising lecture notes and a table detailing LLM architectures. While the fundamental requirement is to generate articulate responses based on reference text, this project will encompass strategies and concepts for extending the agent's capabilities to address more intricate inquiries, including follow-up questions, conversational memory, reference citation, and the ability to process extensive sets of lecture notes spanning multiple subjects.

> The data sources utilized for this project encompass the following:

- [Stanford LLMs Lecture Notes](https://stanford-cs324.github.io/winter2022/lectures/)
- [Awesome LLM Milestone Papers](https://github.com/Hannibal046/Awesome-LLM#milestone-papers)
